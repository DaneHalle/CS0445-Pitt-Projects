<p class="good-important">Many many thanks to Dr. Garrison for this project description and starting code. THANK YOU BASED BILLIAM</p>

<p>In this assignment, you will be implementing a <strong>backtracking</strong> algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. If you aren‚Äôt familiar (or even if you are and need a refresher), <a href="https://www.sudoku.name/rules/en" target="_blank">have a look at this site</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="starting-point">Starting point</h2>

<p><a href="/teaching/classes/cs0445/projects/cs0445_proj3_materials.zip">Download and extract these materials.</a> Contained are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Sudoku.java</code>, <strong>the file you will modify.</strong></li>
  <li>5 <code class="highlighter-rouge">.su</code> files, which are <strong>plain text files</strong> containing Sudoku puzzles to solve.
    <ul>
      <li>Since they‚Äôre plain text files (like java files), you can open them in your text/code editor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Sudoku.java</code> contains the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> method which can accept some command-line arguments.</li>
  <li>the <code class="highlighter-rouge">readBoard</code> method, which reads a board from a file. <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> calls this.
    <ul>
      <li>‚ÄúUnsolved‚Äù (empty) cells contain 0s.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the <code class="highlighter-rouge">printBoard</code> method, which prints the board to the console, which will be very helpful.</li>
  <li>the <code class="highlighter-rouge">solve</code> backtracking template method.</li>
  <li>and finally, 8 ‚Äúskeleton‚Äù methods for you to fill out.
    <ul>
      <li>you know, cause Halloween. üíÄ</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p><strong>We will be testing your code on the command line.</strong> You are welcome to use an IDE, but before submitting, please test that your Java files can be compiled and run on the command line without it.</p>

<p>We should be able to run your program like so:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>java Sudoku <span class="nt">-t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to run all the test methods, or:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>java Sudoku 2-easy.su
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to load and solve a Sudoku board file.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> we gave you handles this command-line interface. But right now, nothing happens :)</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="your-task">Your task</h2>

<p>This is a tough project. As such, <strong>60% of the grade is for correctness, and 40% is for the thoroughness of your testing methods.</strong></p>

<p>You will implement four methods to solve the problem: <code class="highlighter-rouge">isFullSolution</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">reject</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">extend</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code>.</p>

<p>To complement those four, there are four testing methods: <code class="highlighter-rouge">testIsFullSolution</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">testReject</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">testExtend</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">testNext</code>. Each of these should make <strong>several tests</strong> of the corresponding solving methods.</p>

<h3 id="the-puzzle-solving-algorithm">The puzzle-solving algorithm</h3>

<p>By implementing the four solving methods, you will be constructing a backtracking solver program. Important points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must not change any of the original numbers already on the board.</li>
  <li>You must implement all the Sudoku rules: each row, column, and 3x3 square may only contain each number once.</li>
  <li>You only need to find <em>one</em> solution, not all solutions. Once you find a solution, you can stop.</li>
  <li>If a board is not solvable, your program must say so.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-puzzle-solving-methods">The puzzle-solving methods</h3>

<p>These methods make up the four parts of the backtracking template. These methods are <strong>not recursive!</strong> Only the <code class="highlighter-rouge">solve</code> method is, and we already wrote that for you ;)</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean isFullSolution(int[][] board)</code>
    <ul>
      <li>This takes a board as a 2D array, and returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> if it is complete (no empty cells) and satisfies all the rules.</li>
      <li>If there are any empty cells, or if there are any rule violations, it returns false.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean reject(int[][] board)</code>
    <ul>
      <li>This takes a <em>partial</em> solution, and returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> if it is <strong>impossible</strong> to continue with this board.</li>
      <li>For example, if there are two 3‚Äôs on one row, there is no reason to keep solving this board.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">int[][] extend(int[][] board)</code>
    <ul>
      <li>This takes a <em>partial</em> solution, and constructs a <strong>new</strong> partial solution.
        <ul>
          <li>When I say ‚Äúnew‚Äù I mean use <code class="highlighter-rouge">new</code> to allocate a new 2D array!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What I mean by ‚Äúconstructs a new partial solution‚Äù is it <strong>places a number into a previously-empty cell.</strong></li>
      <li>If there are no more possible cells to place a number in, it should return <strong>null.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">int[][] next(int[][] board)</code>
    <ul>
      <li>The partner to <code class="highlighter-rouge">extend</code>. This takes a <em>partial</em> solution, and constructs another <strong>new</strong> partial solution.</li>
      <li>It will <strong>change the most-recently-placed number</strong> to the next possible option.
        <ul>
          <li>So if the most-recently-placed number was a 1, this would change it to a 2‚Ä¶</li>
          <li>‚Ä¶or a 2 to a 3, or a 3 to a 4, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If there are no options for the most-recently-placed number, it should return <strong>null.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="important"><strong>Do not write all the methods at once.</strong> Start with <code class="highlighter-rouge">isFullSolution</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">reject</code>. Test them extensively with your testing methods (by running your program with <code class="highlighter-rouge">java Sudoku -t</code>).</p>

<h3 id="the-testing-methods">The testing methods</h3>

<p>Re-read starting at Chapter 2.16 to review the concepts behind writing test methods. Write your testing methods <em>at the same time you write the solving methods.</em> Have a look at <a href="/teaching/classes/cs0445/examples/Ex18QueensBacktracking.java">this 8-Queens example</a> to see some example testing methods.</p>

<p>For each of the testing methods, try to follow these guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Come up with a variety of partial solutions that will test all possible paths through your solving method.</li>
  <li>Call the method with those partial solutions.</li>
  <li>Check that the method actually returns what you expect it to return.</li>
  <li>Print out the test cases and results, so that you can easily see if things are looking right.</li>
  <li>Include enough test cases that you are convinced that your solving method is working properly.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can make new board files following the guidelines below, and then use <code class="highlighter-rouge">readBoard</code> to load them for testing.</p>

<p>For example, if I were testing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">reject</code> method, I would give it‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
  <li>a board with two of the same number in the same row.</li>
  <li>a board with two of the same number in the same column.</li>
  <li>a board with two of the same number in a 3x3 square.
    <ul>
      <li>(probably a few versions of that, to be thorough.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the boards we gave you (<code class="highlighter-rouge">1-trivial.su</code> etc.) to make sure it <em>doesn‚Äôt</em> reject those.</li>
  <li>a solved board (look online for one) to make sure it <em>doesn‚Äôt</em> reject that.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="example-boards">Example boards</h2>

<p>We‚Äôve included 5 example boards (the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.su</code> files). If you open them in your text editor, you will see they look something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>3__79425_
2__56_197
79_82_4_3
_2__78_41
57_1_6_82
1483_2976
9_7_856_4
4526_7839
_164397_5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are 9 rows, and each has 9 columns. Any non-number character is treated as an empty (unsolved) cell.</p>

<p>You can open one of the existing files and ‚ÄúFile &gt; Save As‚Ä¶‚Äù to make your own boards. Make a bunch! It‚Äôs fine!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>You will submit a ZIP file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">username_proj3.zip</code> where <code class="highlighter-rouge">username</code> is your Pitt username.</p>

<p><strong>Do not put a folder in the zip file, just the following file(s):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Sudoku.java</code></li>
  <li>Any <em>extra</em> boards besides the ones we gave you</li>
  <li>And if anything is wrong/not working, a plain text (.txt) file with notes to the grader about what is not working.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note-important">Do <strong>not</strong> submit any IDE project files.</p>

<p><a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/uj6pq7yim8115vlk8px5tuk8vqd88n5l">Submit to the Box folder at this link.</a> Drag your zip file into your browser to upload. <strong>If you can see your file, you uploaded it correctly!</strong></p>

<p>You can also re-upload if you made a mistake and need to fix it.</p>
